This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and focuses on building a fully interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The main objective was to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic, and basic UI animations.

What I learned?
Throughout the project, I gained experience with:
 - DOM selection and manipulation using JavaScript (getElementById, updating text, classes, etc.).
 - Game logic design, including conditional rules, round tracking, and score calculation.
 - Handling user input and linking buttons to functions (onclick → game choices).
 - Creating a round system with limits, score resets, and win/lose conditions.
 - Designing an optimized match detector to determine if the player wins early.
 - Adding CSS animations (hand shake animation before revealing choices).
 - Using timers (setTimeout) to synchronize animations with game actions.
 - Improving code readability with reusable functions and organized logic.
