This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and involves creating an interactive Etch-a-Sketch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Through this project, I learned how to dynamically generate and manipulate DOM elements, handle events such as mouseover, click, and implement different drawing modes including hover, click, random color, and eraser. I also gained experience managing application state, updating UI feedback through button styling and mode indicators, and rebuilding the grid dynamically based on user input. Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of event-driven programming, DOM interactions, and clean code organization within a web interface.
